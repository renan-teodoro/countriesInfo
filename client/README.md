## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies first, so the front-end will be able to run perfectly.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make changes at the code.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder (if you need to deploy it).\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
